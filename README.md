# BentoBoxWorld default GitHub files
This repository contains the default GitHub files used across most of our repositories.
This includes, but is not limited to:
* issue templates;
* code of conduct;
* contribution guidelines;

This files will be, [per the GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization), applied to any addons that do not already have some.

It is recommended that official BentoBoxWorld addons use these generic files, therefore providing their own alternatives of these files only and only if necessary, in order to keep the user and developer experience consistent between the various projects one may contribute to.
